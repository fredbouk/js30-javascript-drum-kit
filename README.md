# JavaScript Drum Kit
My solution to the JavaScript Drum Kit project from the JavaScript 30 projects challenge by Wes Bos. 
-	NO frameworks, NO compilers, NO libraries, NO boilerplate.

Here are the [starter files](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30/tree/master/01%20-%20JavaScript%20Drum%20Kit) for this project.
